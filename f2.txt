Remember The Time - Michael Jackson

Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together
All day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands?
In each other's eyes
We'd stare, tell me

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
