You Rock My World - Michael Jackson

My life will never be the same
'Cause girl you came and changed 
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain
These things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
stay with me
Fulfill my dreams
And i'll be all tou need

Feels so right (girl)
i've searched for the perfect love all my life
(All my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oohfeels like I (like I)
Have finally found a perfect love this time (and I finally found)
Come on, girl

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think i'd find
Someone like you to call mine
